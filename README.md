# Icome_Level_Prediction_Using_DT

This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually based on demographic and employment attributes. Using the Adult dataset, machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, were applied to build and evaluate a predictive model.

## Overview
This project focuses on:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Building a Decision Tree classifier.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains demographic and employment attributes of individuals, with the target variable indicating whether their income exceeds $50,000 annually.

## Techniques Used
- **Data Preprocessing**: Removal of irrelevant features, one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning**: Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV for optimal parameter selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
